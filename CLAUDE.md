# Ghostie — project guide

Ghostie (formerly "Messages for AI") installs at `/Applications/Ghostie.app`.

A macOS menu bar app that gives Claude **read-only** access to iMessage and
WhatsApp plus a **staged-draft → human-approval → send** flow. Product stance:
"AI proposes, you approve." Differentiator vs. Anthropic's iMessage plugin is
the approval gate, not protocol features.

## Layout

- `menubar/` — SwiftUI menu bar app (SwiftPM, macOS 14+). The UI + the
  draft-approval surface + all health/walkthrough logic.
- `brand/` — the Ghostie brand system: `brand/ghostie/tokens.css` (canonical
  palette), `brand-board.css` + `index.html` (brand board), `sprites/` (the
  canonical pixel mascot — 16 deterministic poses + app icon/favicon
  derivatives), plus `macos-shell/` + `macos-ui/` HTML mocks and
  `pixel-options/` exploration. Heavy raster exploration (character-lab,
  share-site, raster sheets) is deliberately NOT in the repo.
- `mcps/ghostie/` — Ghostie, the generalized stdio MCP facade over
  iMessage and WhatsApp (served name `ghostie-mcp`, Claude config key
  `ghostie`). It exposes stable cross-transport refs and common
  read/search/stage/priority tools. It intentionally does not expose a
  generalized send tool.
- `mcps/shared/` — shared MCP/daemon substrate (JSON-RPC framing,
  daemon client, MCP result envelopes, and untrusted-content wrapping)
  used by the transport packages.
- `mcps/imessage-drafts/` — iMessage stdio MCP **+ chat.db daemon**
  (Bun/TypeScript). The MCP is a thin socket client; the daemon (`src/daemon/`)
  performs all `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` + AddressBook reads because it's
  launched by the menu-bar app (which holds Full Disk Access) — see "FDA is
  launcher-attributed" below.
- `mcps/whatsapp-drafts/` — WhatsApp stdio MCP + Baileys-backed daemon
  (Bun/TypeScript).
- `site/` — marketing site (Vercel project `messages-for-ai-marketing-site`,
  domain `messagesfor.ai`).
- `scripts/` — release + dev-install for the MCP binaries. `release.sh` is the
  one-command lockstep release orchestrator (see Build & dev loop);
  `dev-link-skills.sh` symlinks `skills/*` into `.claude/skills/` for dev.
- `menubar/scripts/` — dev-install + entitlements for the .app.
- `skills/` — Claude Code **skills** (model-invoked how-to + Python/JSX):
  `texting-analytics` (incl. `wrapped/` — the "Texting Wrapped" story-card
  generator, `build_wrapped.py` + Claude-Design `.jsx`), `birthday-reminder`,
  `texting-voice-skill-creator`. Surfaced to Claude via the `.claude-plugin/`
  manifest (single-plugin self-marketplace) + dev symlinks under `.claude/skills/`.
  **Privacy:** the analytics is metadata-only EXCEPT opt-in *aggregate* text
  passes (`emoji_stats.py`, `age_estimate.py`) that emit counts only, never
  message bodies (guard-enforced).
- `.claude-plugin/` — `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` (the Claude Code plugin).
- `research/` — texting-behavior research package (benchmarks, age rubric,
  sources, charts) backing Texting Wrapped.

## Build & dev loop

Dev iteration (~10s, Developer ID signed, NOT notarized):

```
(cd menubar && bash scripts/dev-install.sh)   # rebuild + reinstall the .app
bash scripts/dev-install.sh                    # rebuild all MCP Mach-Os into the .app
```

Run menu bar tests / type-check after Swift changes:

```
(cd menubar && swift build && swift test)
```

MCP unit tests:

```
(cd mcps/ghostie && bun run typecheck && bun test)
(cd mcps/imessage-drafts && bun run typecheck && bun test)
(cd mcps/whatsapp-drafts && bun run typecheck && bun test)
```

One-command release (lockstep .app + plugin; release titles are
"Ghostie vX.Y.Z"; run from `main` after merging PRs — see `RELEASE.md`):

```
bash scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z --dry-run   # preflight only, no changes
bash scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z             # bump versions → build+notarize .app+dmg → tag → gh release
```

It bumps `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + the MCP package versions, runs
`build-release.sh` + `build-dmg.sh`, pushes the tag (which publishes the plugin),
and uploads the `.zip` + stable-named `Messages-for-AI.dmg`. Merges into `main`
use `gh pr merge --admin` (branch protection requires a review that can't be
self-satisfied on a solo repo; CI status checks remain the real gate).

Shipping a release (notarized, reserved for actual GitHub Releases):

```
bash scripts/build-release.sh vX.Y.Z   # → dist/messages-for-ai-vX.Y.Z.zip
bash scripts/build-dmg.sh vX.Y.Z       # → polished .dmg (stable name Messages-for-AI.dmg)
```

## Load-bearing conventions

- **FDA is launcher-attributed, NOT codesign-identifier-keyed.** macOS
  attributes a process's Full Disk Access to its *responsible process* (the app
  that launched it), not to the binary's codesign `Identifier=`. So a
  Claude-launched MCP (Claude Desktop, or the `com.anthropic.claude-code` CLI)
  only gets FDA if **Claude** has FDA — the `Messages for AI` grant on the
  bundle does NOT reach it. (This corrects the earlier assumption; see the #17
  saga. Verified: two sibling MCPs under one FDA-holding Claude Desktop — the
  one Desktop launched directly reads chat.db; the one `claude-code` launched is
  denied. Same binary, same grant.) **Architecture consequence:** all FDA-gated
  reads live in `imessage-drafts-daemon`, which the **menu-bar app launches** —
  so the daemon's responsible process is the menu-bar (which the user grants
  `Ghostie` FDA). The iMessage MCP is a thin client over
  `~/.messages-mcp/daemon.sock`, peer-authed by codesign Identifier+Team (MCP
  and daemon share `com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai`). **Claude never needs
  FDA.** The WhatsApp daemon already worked this way; the iMessage daemon
  mirrors it (`mcps/imessage-drafts/src/daemon/` reuses peer-auth/peer-pid/
  codesign/rpc-client from the WhatsApp daemon).
- **One codesign identifier across every inner Mach-O.**
  `com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai` is signed onto the menu bar binary and all
  bundled backend launchers (generalized MCP, transport MCPs, daemons, and
  generators). It's what makes peer-auth's same-identity check work and keeps
  the bundle seal coherent.
  **Sign each inner Mach-O explicitly with `--identifier` before sealing;
  `codesign --deep` clobbers `--identifier`, so the bundle seal uses NO
  `--deep`.** A Developer-ID re-sign *preserves* the menu-bar's FDA grant (it's
  keyed to the signing identity, cdhash-tolerant), so dev-install cycles don't
  require re-granting FDA.
- **State/config locations.** Settings: `~/.messages-mcp/settings.json` (v2
  schema, nested `transports.{imessage,whatsapp}`; flat `require_approval`
  mirrored at root for older MCP processes). Drafts:
  `~/.messages-mcp/drafts/`; managed iMessage draft media:
  `~/.messages-mcp/draft-attachments/<draft-id>/`. iMessage daemon:
  `~/.messages-mcp/daemon.sock` +
  `daemon.pid`; log `~/.messages-mcp/logs/imessage-daemon.log`. WhatsApp daemon
  state: `~/.whatsapp-mcp/` (session.db, daemon.sock, daemon.pid, messages.db,
  audit.db, drafts/, draft-attachments/); log
  `~/.messages-mcp/logs/whatsapp-daemon.log`.
- **Non-popover UI uses real `Window` scenes** (`Window(id:)` +
  `openWindow`/`dismissWindow`), not `MenuBarExtra(.window)` sheets (focus-bleed
  dismisses the popover). `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed =
  false` keeps the menu bar alive; activation policy flips `.accessory` ↔
  `.regular` by visible-window count.
- **Hardened Runtime needs per-Mach-O entitlements.** Each inner binary must
  embed its own `--entitlements` (the Bun-compiled binaries need
  `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` + `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` or Bun's
  JIT SIGTRAPs on first hot-loop recompile). Bundle-level entitlements do NOT
  propagate to inner Mach-Os.

## Rebrand invariants (Ghostie rename — what must NEVER be renamed)

The 0.7.0 rebrand changed the product name, the .app bundle name
(`/Applications/Ghostie.app`), UI strings, and the plugin name — and
deliberately nothing else. These identifiers are load-bearing and stay on the
old names:

- **Bundle ID + codesign identifier `com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai`** — TCC
  keys the FDA grant by (identifier, team-id); peer-auth between MCPs and
  daemons checks the same identity. Renaming it invalidates every user's FDA
  grant and breaks peer-auth.
- **`~/.messages-mcp/` + `~/.whatsapp-mcp/` state dirs** — existing installs
  read settings, drafts, sockets, and logs there. A rename strands user state.
- **DMG filename `Messages-for-AI.dmg`** — the stable download URL on GitHub
  Releases; docs and the marketing site link to it.
- **`SUFeedURL` (Sparkle appcast URL)** — shipped apps poll the existing URL;
  changing it orphans every installed copy from updates.
- **Notary keychain profile** — NOT a true invariant: a local keychain name
  only, overridable via `NOTARY_PROFILE`. The scripts now default to `ghostie`;
  older machines may still carry the legacy `imessage-mcp-notary` profile.
- **Binary names** (`MessagesForAIMenu`, `messages-for-ai-backend`,
  `imessage-drafts-mcp`, `whatsapp-drafts-mcp`, daemons) — MCP client configs
  and the launcher dispatch table point at them; `ghostie-mcp` is additive.

The on-disk .app path is NOT stable across the rename (Sparkle updates
in-place at the old path; fresh installs land at `Ghostie.app`) — that is why
`HealthChecks.defaultBundleBinaryPrefix` derives the prefix at runtime and
`ClaudeConfigMigrator` rewrites stale config paths at launch.

## Notarization diagnostic (notarytool 1.1.0)

`notarytool submit` can exit with **SIGBUS / signal 10** *after* the upload
completes and Apple acknowledges it — the crash is in notarytool's
response-printing path (`__CFStringCreateImmutableFunnel3`), **not** a failure of
the submission and **not** RAM/coalition pressure (those were earlier
mis-diagnoses). The release scripts handle it: wrap `submit` in `set +e`, recover
the UUID from `notarytool history` when the JSON output is blanked, and poll with
`notarytool info --output-format json` (short response) rather than
`notarytool wait` (long response re-triggers the formatter crash).

Notary keychain profile defaults to `ghostie` (older machines may still carry
the legacy `imessage-mcp-notary` profile). Override with `NOTARY_PROFILE` if your
keychain differs.
